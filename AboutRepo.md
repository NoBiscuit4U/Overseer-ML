This repo is my library for machine learning.
Here are a few things about this repo.

-I will research new and interesting topics and learn/implement them into code.

-I will also minimize the usage of other libraries mainly only using numpy.

Since I will be working with csvs for training and test datasets, any csvs used will
have an associate link in a text file pertaining to the location to which I found it
